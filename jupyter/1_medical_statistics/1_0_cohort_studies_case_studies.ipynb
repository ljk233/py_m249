    "## What are cohort and case-control studies?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cohort studies** and **case-control studies** are studies of the association between an exposure $E$ and a disease $D$ *(pp8, pp23-24)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a cohort study, $E$ is known and $D$ is unknown.\n",
    "Alternatively, in a case-control study, it is $D$ that is known prior to the study, and $E$ is unknown *(pp24)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **retrospective** cohort study is one which occurs after both the outcome has happended.\n",
    "The analysis then looks back to the time the outcome happeneded to determine their exposure *(pp11 and [Boston University School of Public Health, 2017](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/ep/ep713_analyticoverview/ep713_analyticoverview3.html))*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The controls in a case-control study should be chosen from the same population as that of the cases.\n",
    "After that, then the exposure category can be determined *(pp24)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both can be analysed by a two-by-two **contingency table**.\n",
    "Contingency table for a cohort study *(pp10):*\n",

    "## Measures of association\n",
    "\n",
    "A **measure of association** is a means to quantify the strength of an association *(pp7)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relative risk\n",
    "\n",
    "The **relative risk**, $RR$, is the ratio of having the disease and being exposed, to having the disease and not being exposed *(pp11-12)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be estimated using\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{RR} = \\frac{\\hat P (D|E)}{\\hat P (D|\\text{not } E)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It cannot be directly estimated in a case-control study *(pp25)*, but it can be indirectly estimated from the the odds ratio *(pp15)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative risk is a good measure to use when communicating some findings to the general public. *(pp15).*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Odds and the odds ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "The **odds of an event**, $OD$, is defined as the ratio of the probability of an event occuring to the probability of the event not occuring *(pp13-14).*\n",
    "\n",
    "$$OD(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{P(\\text{Not } A)} = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a cohort study it possible to estimate the odds of *disease given exposure,* so $\\widehat{OD} (D | E)$ and $\\widehat{OD} (D | \\text{ Not } E)$ *(pp13).*\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{OD} (D | E) = \\frac{a}{b}, \\hspace{3mm} \\widehat{OD} (D | \\text{ Not } E) = \\frac{c}{d}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, case-control studies can estimate the odds of *exposure given disease*, so $\\widehat{OD} (E | D)$ and $\\widehat{OD} (E | \\text{ Not } D)$ *(p27).*\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{OD} (E | D) = \\frac{a}{c}, \\hspace{3mm} \\widehat{OD} (E | \\text{ Not } D) = \\frac{b}{d}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **odds ratio**, $OR$, is defined as the ratio of the odds of a disease happening given exposure to the odds of the disease happening given no exposure.\n",
    "It represents the **strength of assocation.**\n",
    "Like $RR$ a postive value represents a *positive* association, and a negative value represents a *negative* association *(pp13-14).*\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be shown that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{OR} = \\frac{\\widehat{OD} (D | E)}{\\widehat{OD} (D | \\text{ Not } E)} = \\frac{\\widehat{OD} (E | D)}{\\widehat{OD} (E | \\text{ Not } D)} = \\frac{ad}{bc}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the calculation of the odds ratio is the same for both cohort and case-control studies *(pp27).*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing the relative risk and odds ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! Note Review this sub-section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence intervals for measures of association\n",
    "\n",
    "The point estimates for the relative risk and the odds ratio are subject to sampling variability.\n",
    "A confidence interval can be used to quantify this uncertainty *(pp16).*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done using a **binomial model,** with the assumption that the number of disease outcomes for the exposed group are independent of the number of diseased outcome of the control group *(pp17).*\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! Note Expand this to include some interpretation, specifically when the interval includes 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple exposure categories\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick an exposure category as an arbitrary **reference** category.\n",
    "All ratio are then calculated relative to this reference category *(pp29-30).*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing for no association\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! Note Break this section down futher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chi-squared test for no association\n",
    "\n",
    "A **chi-squared test for no association** tests the null hypothesis that there is no association between the exposure and the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a need for a reference category, then the test is not affected by the choice of reference category, as all values are taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "The test requires all expected frequencies to be greater than or equal to **five** for it to be adequate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chi-squared contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! Note Missing note\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Degrees of freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "The degrees of freedom for the test when using a **2x2** contingency table is **1.**\n",
    "Otherwise, use $\\nu = (r - 1)\\hspace{2mm}(c - 1).$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The p-value and interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The $p$-value and $\\widehat{OR}$ are often reported together:\n",
    "The $p$-value quantifies the strength of the *evidence;* $\\widehat{OR}$ quantifies the strength of *association.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fisherâ€™s exact test\n",
